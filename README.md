# GTD + Emacs Â· Task Manager

A powerful, self-contained task management application for Emacs that organizes tasks into six distinct sections: Inbox, Today, Monday, Month, Calendar, and Someday. This task manager is based on the GTD+R (Getting Things Done + Rodhia) methodology by Kenji Ohta, https://gtd-r.blogspot.com/ which combines David Allen's GTD principles with a structured review system.

## GTD+R Methodology

The task manager implements the GTD+R methodology, which consists of three core principles:

## Daily Routine
At the start of each day:
- Open the Today and Week section and select tasks to focus on Today.
- Review the Week section to align with weekly goals.
- Adjust tasks between sections as necessary.

## Weekly Review
Conduct a review every Monday:
- Assess progress on tasks in Week and Today sections.
- Evaluate Monday section tasks for movement to Week or Today.
- Adjust accordingly.

## Monthly Review
On the first of each month:
- Inspect Someday section tasks.
- Sort relevant tasks into Today, Week, or Monday sections, or leave in Someday.
- Archive tasks that can be closed.

The task manager automatically helps with this workflow through:
- Automatic migration of Today tasks to Week at 3 AM
- Regular backups to prevent data loss
- Easy movement between sections
- Quick task entry and editing
- Flexible organization with tags and due dates

## Features

- **Tags**: Add and manage tags for better organization
- **Reminders**: Set reminders for important tasks
- **Search**: Find tasks across all sections
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by properties like priority, due date, or tags
- **Import/Export**: Import tasks from org-agenda or export to various formats
- **Automatic Backups**: Scheduled backups to prevent data loss
